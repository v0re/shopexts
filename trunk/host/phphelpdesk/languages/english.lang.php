<?php //ENGLISH language file
/*

   To whom it may concern:

   The only language that I really know good is English.  I have made this
   file available so that other language speaking people can modify these
   variables so that PHP Helpdesk will work for other languages.  If you can
   help translate the following variables into another language, then please
   email me at joe@networkpenguin.com.  I will then let you know if someone
   else has already done this translation.  If they have not, then I will ask
   for your help in the translation.  I will need you to then translate these
   variables into the other language and send me an email with the document
   attached.  I will then add the language to the project so that other can
   benefit from your translations.  It will then appear in the project as:

     languages/yourlanguage.lang.php

   Thank You in advance,

   Joe Hoot
