CHANGELOG (This is probably not everything.  I've neglected to keep a good log) 

20-08-2003
since a long break the system was new build using the old code. The main changes are:

-Complete new layout and GUI, based on CSS and layout structure
which makes it easier to adapt the system to a different layout. 
(single layout elements almost without PHP)
- The Sessionmanagement is now done with PHP sessionvariables
- An wizzard was added to add jobs and requests.
- The departmentcategories where replaced by a more user  orientated
system with request and problem categories and items where the user can
chosse from. New dialogs where addedto administrate requests and the request categories.
- Possibilites to preassign jobs. A feature which was much
asked for, to predefine a user to which are task directly assigned when
they are created (based on categories)
- Additional eMail notifications. Up to 2 extra persons can be notified
in addtition. (Administracion over the admin GUI)
- Some filed where added as Proposed Solution, Staff number, etc...
- Some extra code documentation
- Currency changes implemented

/* STILL TO DO */
- Update the stock management 
- Translation of the languages files
- Update report section (currently they are not availbale)
- Print "Last On" somewhere
- 

- 2001-08-01 -
	- modified the helpdesk-install script to include language files
	James E. Hicks III pointed this out.  Thanks James.
	- modified the header to have a background image so that is looks
	nicer.
	- updated italian.lang.php from Luca Berlinghieri [luca.berlinghieri@itline.it]
	- updated german.lang.php from Daniel Götz [info@daniel-goetz.de]

- 2001-07-17 -
	- modified the vj_showtickets.scp.php and viewjobs.scp.php scripts
	so that the user needs to have $s_delete_tickets = 1 in order to
	be allowed to delete tickets instead of $is_manager.

- 2001-07-16 -
        - Began work on new language variables (for recently added
	functions).  Now, the english version is always loaded, so
	if a variable is missing in a language file, the user will
	at least see the english version instead of nothing.  Added
	file languages/README where we will list new variables which
	must be added by translators.

- 2001-07-12 -
        - Added delete ticket feature -- user must have security 
	"Is Manager" to see this option (to avoid adding a field
	to the database).
	- Various bug fixes in user stats report and search feature.

- 2001-07-11 -
        - Added timestampToUnix() function to inculdes/functions, this
	makes it easy to convert MySQL timestamps to Unix format.
	- Added date range entry to user stats report.
	- Implemented basic Search feature.

- 2001-07-10 -
        - Added User Stats Report.
	- Added CGI variable $rpt.  If this is set, the headings,
	footers and menu will not print.  This should be set for
	screens that are intended to be printed.

- 2001-07-09 -
        - Made text areas slightly larger when adding events and
	adding/changing the long description in a ticket.
	- Added subdirectory scripts/reports where all the
	various report scripts will go.  Moved the existing
	report there, and added a reporting menu.
	- Made minor cosmetic changes
	- Added heading() function to includes/functions.inc.php.
	This can be used to make consistant headings on all
	the pages.  Right now it simply puts 2 horizontal lines
	and the heading text in a larger font.

- 2001-07-08 - 
        - Added change password feature.
	- Chaned all SQL calls to use query() function from 
	includes/functions.inc.php.  This is a step towards the
	database abstraction layer.  The next step is to make
	the query function return an array or object  rather than
	a mysql_result variable.
	- Added some ORDER BY clauses to various SQL statements
	to make list boxes in forms be in alphabetical order.

- 2001-07-03 -
        Added new file includes/functions.inc.php for global functions.
	Added 2 functions to this file:
	 - showSummary() which displays 2 lines; qty tickets open, and 
 	    qty tickets open and assigned to current user.   I also added a 
	    call to showSummary() in the file config/header.conf.php so it 
	    appears in the blue status bar at the top.
	 - query( $q ) which executes mysql queries ($q is the query to
	    execute), checks and prints errors, and returns the result set.
	    If debugging is turned on ($debug=1 in config/general.conf.php)
	    it will also print the SQL which was sent to MySQL.
	Added a second sql file (empty.mysql) to create empty tables
	for a fresh PHP Helpdesk installation.  I found a problem with
	phphelpdesk.mysql, it adds events for tickets which don't exist.
	We should clean it up at some point, it's nice to have for demo
	purposes.

- 2001-07-01 -
        Modified includes/cookie.inc.php to fix a problem with some
	versions of MS Internet Explorer.

- 2001-06-26 -
	Added a spanish.lang.php file

- 2001-06-21 -
	Added a german.lang.php file

- 2001-06-17 -
	Modified all the language files to get rid of the white space at the end
	of the files.  The white space was creating header errors.
	Modified the character set to a Latin1 character set instead of windows.
	Added a few more language files to CVS.
	Released a new version of PHPHelpdesk v0.6.1.

- 2001-05-23 -
	Finished changing all the scripts to use the language files in /languages/

- 2001-05-22 -
	Continued to change the scripts for language module
	Finished the language module use.
	Users can finally start adding language files

- 2001-05-21 -
	Added more variables to the language files
	added language module capability to adduser.scp.php and deletecategory.scp.php

- 2001-05-17 -
	Added some more variables to the language files
	added language module capability to the addjob.scp.php and addparts.scp.php

- 2001-05-16 -
	Added languages/swedish.lang.php
	Added languages/english.lang.php
	Modified all code except many script files to reflect the new language module.
	Have only modified addcategory.scp.php, adddepartment.scp.php in the scripts/
	directory to use language files.  I will try to finish up the other script files 
	by the end of the week.

- 2001-05-11 -
	I think I may have fixed the cookie issue.

- 2001-05-09 -
	added a language folder with english.lang.php in it.  This will be the 
	folder where all language files will reside.  

- 2001-05-06 -
	added g_domainmailfrom variable in case you are using a virtual server
	and need email to look like it is being sent from another machine.  Updated
	scripts/addjob.scp.php so that this variable can be used.

- 2001-04-26 -
	modified scripts/deletedepartments to stripslashes so it displays correctly

- 2001-04-25 -
	modified scripts/deletedepartments.scp.php and the adddepartments to handle
	the g_dept_or_comp variable.
	modified scripts/adddepartments.scp.php to addslashes and stripslashes from
	the newly added department.
	modified includes/permissions.inc.php to include s_email.
	modified scripts/addjob.scp.php so that when a user adds a ticket, if $s_email
	has an email address then an email will be sent to that address.  If it is empty
	then no email will be sent to that user.  So, if you have a user created for
	the Sales department, for example, you would include the email address of an
	authorizing person in their users' profile so that whenever someone inputs a 
	ticket, that authorizing person will get an email.
	Also, this has been in the database tables for awhile now, but there is a 
	field called s_isroot in the security table.  If that is set to 1 for any
	given user, then that user will have root on the phphelpdesk and get access
	to all departments.

- 2001-04-23 -
	commented out the MSIE 4.01 fixes from includes/cookie.inc.php and
	includes/logout.inc.php.  You can enable them by uncommenting the comments,
	but when I tried leaving it in, I still had the login problem.  I will try
	to implement sessions shortly, but this problem will still exist until we
	can find a way to eliminate the cookie problems.

- 2001-04-20 -
	modified vj_viewtickets.scp.php to do a second sort on date opened so that you 
	would not only get the list of tickets by priority, but also sorted on oldest
	first.  Also, bumped up the default refresh time for the viewjobs to 10 minutes.
	Added a nice little javascript for highlighting each ticket.  It can be turned
	off by doing javascript_enable = 0.

- 2001-04-17 -
	fixed the scripts/adduser.scp.php so that <?echo $g_base_url?> would take
	the user to the correct page.

- 2001-04-15 -
	added html_alt_color config variables so that the alternating colors can be
	changing when viewing tickets.  I will start working on a preferences for each
	user at some point.

- 2001-04-14 -
	added a few fields to security and ticket.  Added a computer ID field so
	that you can track how many times a computer gets serviced.  Added a
	reports section.  Modified the time fields so that the time is human readable.
	Made the "assigned to" field visible during View Jobs.  Added upgrade scripts.
	Fixed a section in Add Parts so that the parts are added and subtracted
	correctly.  Changed some things in the config file as to accomidate those
	who were having problems using a virtual host.  Date Opened field is now 
	sorting correctly. Tried fixing the cookie problem using code from 
  	somebody who posted it on the phphelpdesk.sourceforge.net site on
	01-03-29 04:52 in response to Eric Jolents post in Support Requests.  Added
	some style sheets to make it look nice.

- 5.18.00 -
	some code cleanup, addition of a "Mail To Assigned User" 
	on Add Job form, bug fix before the INSERT query on the add job
	form (It would bomb out when the detail included "'`~@#$(*&%" types
	of characters), and the addition of a logout link.

- 12.6.00 -
	So much has changed since v.03.  Basically, I through up the last version
	because my company really needed a program quickly.  I didn't give a lot
	of thought to the code and pretty much just through it together quickly.  
	This new version, on the other hand, was thought out a lot better.  Security
	is still a very big issue.  This program is by _NO MEANS_ secure.  It has
	code for authentication, but a user might be able to simple throw some 
	variables into the url and be able to access certain areas.  This will
	be my main focus on the next version.  Version .04 is to be considered
	useable, but insecure and still alpha/beta.. whatever you want to call it.

	In any case, the following has changed:
	- groups have been eliminated in exchange for a permission based on rights
	to certain things.  In the future, phphelpdesk may have the ability to define
	groups that have certain permissions.  But not right now.
	- tickets now have events associated with them, among other things.
	- users can be a member of many different departments.
	- users now have preferences.  Only one thing is in there at the moment.
	Eventually themes will be available in this section.
	- there is a duration associated with each event (which is associated with a ticket #).
	This duration is the amount of time spent on each ticket.
	- A printable version of the ticket shows up after you close the ticket.  You
	can also press a button while viewing the ticket and it will show a printable
	version.
	- code has been cleaned up a little bit.
