 REQUIREMENTS

    For basic functionality you need the following:

	A web server (Apache is recommended)
	MySQL
	PHP 4.0 or greater with MySQL support enabled

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

1)  You can simply move directory that contains this document to the place
    where you would like to run this program. 

2)  There are a few files that you should examine (and probably edit),
    they can be found in the config directory.  There are only 2 files
    that you must edit (general.conf.php and db.conf.php):

   *general.conf.php       	- This is where you configure certain
                                  global settings.
   *db.conf.php      	        - This is where you configure certain
                                  database settings.
    html.conf.php	        - this is the default settings to use for html in addition to the CSS


3)  Once all of the above is setup, you need to create the database and
    tables on your server.  You can find the SQL for this in 
    phphelpdesk.mysql, for example.  Presently only MySQL is supported.
    You can do this by doing something similar to the following:

  [johnuser@somehost helpdesk]$mysql -u root -p < phphelpdesk.mysql
  Enter password: (password is only required if you have a password set)

  * NOTE: you will need the root password to create this database

    This will create a database called phphelpdesk, grant all privileges
    on this database to a user "phphdadmin" with a password "phphdpasswd", create
    the tables for this database, and create a user "admin" with the
    password "admin".
	
	Beside that you can also use MySQL packages as for instance PHPmyAdmin to create 
	the Database and insert the data. 

4)  The final step is to go to the $g_base_url that you set in general.conf.php
    and login with the username "admin" and password "admin".  Once
    you've done that, you will see more options.  Choose "Add Department".
    Create a department.  Then Choose "Add User".  Create a user for yourself
    with all privileges GRANTED.  This will ensure that you have root privileges
    on the system.  Logoff, and try the username and password that you just made.
    If everything works ok and you get in, then delete the "admin" user.

5)  You're all set!  Enjoy!
